        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <h4>I am a first year student who has a passion for all things statistics/probability related. My main areas of interest include random variables, markov chains, and quantatitive finance.
            I look at computer science as a tool to utilize statistical knowledge. I feel that the two fields have increadibly synergy with one another which led me to pursue majors in both. Non academically I enjoy
            reading all sorts of books, watching wrestling, and playing Riichi mahjong and poker. I pretty much made this site to showcase my various projects/notes as well as just ideas I find interesting. Hope you enjoy!
