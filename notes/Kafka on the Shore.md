## Summery:

Very good fictional novel. The longest book I've read in a long time. I genuinely found it entertaining and enjoyed the themes discussed such as fate, learning to live with the absurdity of the world, and above all else a beautiful coming of age story not only for Kafka but for the other characters as well. From Nakatas journey to see the world and Hiroshi becoming fed up with living a "hollow" life to of course, the rebellious Kafka learning what it means to live. Only complaints I would have is that Nakatas chapters are much more boring than Kafka's and I found myself often times slugging through them to get to the next Kafka chapter. Great read though and I look forward to reading more of Murakami's books. 9/10 imo since while there were very little flaws and it keep me engaged for the majority of the book, it never kicked into that final emotional gear that I feel that stories such as [[Usogui]] and others have. 



### Chapter 1-3
* "Sometimes fate is like a small sandstorm that keeps changing direction. You change direction, but the sandstorm chases you. You turn again, but the storm adjusts" (3)
* Already a very strong introduction that sets up interesting themes to be explored that they can hopefully execute well on
* Already seeing similarities in themes to [[Meditations]], [[Vagabond]], and [[The Myth of Sisyphus]] in that it says accepting the world as is 
* OK we can agree that "the Boy named crow" is an alter ego of Kafka right?
* Wtf is this government document thing and the Rice Bowl incident I'm a bit confused but we will prob find more about it later 
* It is interesting on how they reference chance encounters (similar to the first paragraph of fate never leaving us)
* This girl seems interesting especially if she is his sister as it would play into the chance encounter aspect more 
* This mf rly says "she may be my sister" before going back to imagining her boobs again 
### Chapter 4-6
* I like the confrontation between Kafka and the school kids where he says "we are going down different tracks in more ways than one"
* I actually guessed correctly that the boy who never regained consciousness was the other main character
* What is this male/male, female/male, female/female dialogue? Is it something to do with being gay? Or is it more like the bookkeeper said you can't live your life alone and we spend our life looking for that other half of ours 
	* In chapter 6 this is touched on again thank god 
	* Very interested to see how this theme develops as I am curious what they mean by "other half"
* "All alone in an unfamiliar place like some explorer whose lost his compass and map. Is this what it means to be free?" (46)
	* Possibly similar to my writing [[Lost in Suburbia]]? Hopefully this is explored more 
* Why are the cats talking
* Could the other man the cats saw with half a shadow be Kafka?
* "Wether you're smart or dumb, can read or can't, weather you've got a shadow or not, once the time comes, everybody passes on" (54)
* Love the introduction of Nakata so far since I love the archetype of the man who has already lived his life and completed his journey but still can go on one more
	* We are going to see this journey of Kafka and Nakata trying to find their true selves? Whatever it is I'm very curious about how they connect the two stories
### Chapter 7-9
* "I'll just think about now. About books waiting to be read in the library, machines in the gym I haven't worked out on. Thinking about anything else isn't going to get me anywhere" (59
	* Thinking about the distant future has no use 
* In chapter 7 I love the references to [[Franz Kafka]] not only in a literal sense but in a sense of that they have similar philosophies
	* I wonder what he means about the mechanism in The Penal Colony in that its all around him
* Chapter 9 was really intense I think he probably killed someone with his alternate "Crow" ego
### Chapter 10-12
* Final page of chapter 10  (90) is really interesting
* "Fate seems to be taking me in some even stranger directions" (101)
* Chapter 11 is weird
### Chapter 13-15
* Chapter 15 easily one of my favorites so far
* The discussion of the Nazi who just did as he was told starts an interesting discussion about what we truly are responsible for 
	* "In dreams begin responsibility. You can say that where there's no power to imagine, no responsibility can arise" (141)
	* Don't quite understand that quote but this subject of responsibility is definitely brought about again in the next chapter 
* "Not only the stars- how many other things haven't I noticed in the world, things I know nothing about? I suddenly feel helpless, completely powerless. And I know I'll never outrun that awful feeling" (145)
	* Answer to this question is absurdist philosophy laid out in [[The Myth of Sisyphus]]
	* It's OK to feel powerless in the grand scheme of the universe
### Chapter 16-18
* Man chapter 16 was fucking insane and gory Jonnie Walker dude is a fucking sick man 
* Jonnies philosophy is very interesting tho
	* Main idea of his is that we all have beliefs that we are fighting for and when those beliefs stand in the way of one another, it leads to "war" as shown with his desire to kill the cats and Nakata's desire to save them
	* This dude def has OCD tho the way he be saying their is so many steps and such 
### Chapter 19-21
* Oshima being a women is surprising; I also find his philosophy he describes in chapter 19 interesting about people who fill up their soul with empty words and phrases, with a lack of imagination
* The fish and leeches raining down is weird as fuck but Nakata is so cute and nice lmao
* The dialogue between Oshima and Kafka in chapter 21 is amazing
	* "It feels like everything's been decided in advance- that I'm following a path somebody else has already mapped out for me. It doesn't matter how much I think it over, how much effort I put into it. The harder I try, the more I lose my sense of who I am" (214)
		* Don't look back [[Usogui]]
	* Oshima responds to this by saying that no matter if this is true or not it doesn't matter, you are the only person who is yourself and your going on this journey of life as only yourself
	* Hopefully this theme carries more into the rest of the book
* Stuff is definitely getting weird. Kafka just killed his dad in a dream 
### Chapter 22-24
* Nakata's life sounds absolutely miserable up to this point (doing literally the same thing everyday with little to no emotions) but the funny part is that for him, it's absolutely perfect
* "Maybe she doesn't really exist, but just thinking about her makes my heart- my flesh and blood, my real heart - thump like mad. These feelings are as real as the blood all over my chest that awful night" (240)
* Something I love is that even though Kafka and Nakata have not met yet you here mentions of the other from the newspaper
### Chapter 25-27
* This really is turning to a supernatural book 
* Fate is definitely a main idea of this book 
* "As long as there's such a thing as time, everybody's damaged in the end, changed into something else. It always happens, sooner or later" (267)
	* This is why Miss Saeki wants to go to a place where time doesn't exist
* Exploring the concept of motherly love like [[Vagabond]]
* How am I JUST now realizing that Kafka's chapters are in 1st person and Nakata's are in 3rd person 
* Why is the KFC dude here what the actual fuck is going on
* "The most important job is surviving from one day to the next. It could be simple, or very hard. It all depends on how you look at it. Either way, even if things go well, that's not some great achievement. Nobodies going to give me a standing ovation or anything" (286)
	* Oshima continues to be one of the most interesting characters
	* Reminds me of my [[Obsessive Compulsive Disorder]] in that I do these normal activities that while hard for me, seem completely stupid to any normal person
	* Because of this, it doesn't matter how other people look at our achievements, what matters is how OURSELF feels about it, it really does just depend on how you look at it 

### Chapter 28-30 
* Chapters 28 and 29 are both really short and weird and both involve sexual encounters, not much to say about either than them other than that 
### Chapter 31-33
* Chapter 31 is absolutely insane; I was a bit confused in the scene with Mrs. Saeki and Kafka by the water but I think I get it
* When the book refers to "you" in the second person, I feel like its almost like we are dreaming pr imagining this while reading maybe? It could also be you as in her previous boyfriend because she says "why did you have to die". Either way I'm excited to see how this turns out 
* That chapter genuinely felt like the end of the first half of the book or something
* "Anyone who falls in love is searching for the missing pieces of themselves. So anyone who's in love gets sad when they think of their lover. It's like stepping back inside a room you have fond memories of, one you haven't seen in a long time." (319)
	* Do I feel this way with Alice?
	* Honestly I'm not sure which makes me question our love a bit 
* "The earth slowly keeps on turning but beyond any of those details of the real, there are dreams. And everyone's living in them" (322)
	* Beautiful quote to end what I would say is the first half of the book
	* We all have our own goals and dreams which we are pursuing every day as well as literal dreams 
	* This goes back to Jonnie Walkers philosophy in a way
	* The main theme of this book is clearly the seperation (or lack of) between dreams and reality
* "Perhaps most people in the world aren't trying to be free. They just think they are" (339)
	* We enjoy the safety and security of having fences and guards surrounding us, most people could not handle a truly free world 
### Chapter 34-36
* "The world would be a real mess if everybody was a genius. Somebody's got to keep watch, take care of business" (350)
	* This realization by Hoshino is cool and true
	* Everybody is valued in the world, not just those with pure intelligence, everyone has something to offer
* "People are born in order to live, right? But the longer I've lived, the more I've lost what's inside me - and ended up empty. And I bet the longer I live, the emptier, the more worthless, I'll become. Something's wrong with this picture. Life isn't supposed to turn out like this! Isn't it possible to shift direction, to change where I'm headed?" (352)
	* I feel like sometimes these quotes while good could be tied into the story better and sit on the edge of being pretentious 
		* Honestly not this quote though because it's what makes him realize he doesn't want to go back to his job
	* I feel this in myself and see it around me, people as they get older fall into the repetitiveness of life. As a kid right now, I feel free but I know that that freedom is fading. But does it have to be this way? Do I have to go to work every day and do the exact same thing and live the exact same way every day? I sure hope not. 
* Nakata getting tied into the murder is genius WAIT WHAT IF HIS DAD WAS FUCKING JONNIE WALKER
### Chapter 37-40
* The stories are finally connecting....
* Wtf is going on with Kafka in the cabin and what does he mean by his "monster coming out" is bro just that edgy
* I predict the item Nakata is searching for is the Kafka on the Shore painting but why I have no clue 
### Chapter 41-46
* Chapter 41 is just such a lonely description of sadness
* RIP Nakata... was not expecting that 
* "Memories warm you from the inside. But they also tear you apart. " (420)
* It makes sense that that stone that Nakata was searching for was the entrance to the forest Kafka is in right now 
* The forest is depressing as hell. It's literally a bunch of tortured, hollow souls stuck in limbo without time or aging
### Chapter 47-49
* Chapter 47 is absolutely beautiful, an amazing development for Kafka as a character
	* He choses to live in the real world despite its flaws, despite him not knowing who he is yet instead of staying in the limbo world where time and age is non existent 
	* Kafka has the courage to face the real world, great character 
* The don't look back dialogue reminds me of [[Usogui]]
* "Lost opportunities, lost possibilities, feelings we can never get back. That's part of what it means to be alive. But inside our heads- at least that's where I imagine it- there's a little room where we store these memories" (501)
	* No matter what happens in life including the pains and struggles, we always have our memories to look back 
	* "At that subtle moment when man glances backward over his life, Sisyphus returning toward his rock, in that slight pivoting he contemplates that series of unrelated actions which becomes his fate, created by him, combined under his memory's eye and soon sealed by his death" [[The Myth of Sisyphus]]
* Very nice ending chapter showing growth and tons of development for Kafka
	* Kafka finally found something to live for, remembering Miss Saeki and carrying on her legacy with him
	* Honestly a really interesting choice of an ending but I like it; he gave up on his dream to run away and instead chose to accept the world around him and live the best he can
* Kafka has the meaning to live: "look at the painting and listen to the wind" [[Vagabond]]
