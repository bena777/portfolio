## Thoughts
Excellent overall book with some of the most impressive prose I have ever seen. Solid 8-9/10 for me with my only gripe being the scenes where he decorated his house and went through all his interests I feel the author went into a bit TOO much detail l describing every single individual jewel and what not. Definitely an amazing book though that conveys a lot and makes you think in just over 200 pages. 
### Core ideas:
* The superficiality of appearances mostly conveyed by Sir Henry who actually may of been my favorite character just due to his outlandish ideas (some better than others)
* Corruption of the soul through hedonism 
* The idea of prioritizing sensing and having new experiences over all else. I agree with this to and extent which is why I have previously said that I don't want to live in a suburb when I'm older due to every day feeling like the same (an idea they actually kind of touched on in the book)


## Annotations:
### Chapter 2:
- "Because to influence a person is to give him one's own soul. He does not think his natural thoughts, or burn with his natural passions. His virtues are not real to him. His sins, if there are such things as sins, are borrowed. He becomes an echo of some one else's music, an actor of a part that has not been written for him. The aim of life is self-development. To realize one's nature perfectly - that is what each of us is here for. People are of themselves, nowadays They have forgotten the highest of all duties, the duty that one owes to one's self" (17)
	- Wow. A phenomenal paragraph that perfectly describes the philosophy by Lord Henry in the first few pages of the book.
	- His selfish philosophy is certainty interesting. He is a man who has a way of thinking and does not let anyone "influence" that way of thinking
	- This truly showed me from the start how impressive the prose in this story is 
### Chapter 4:
- "People are very fond of giving away what they need most themselves. It is what I call the depth of generosity" (55)
- "Good artists exist simply in what they make, and consequently are perfectly uninteresting in what they are" (56)
### Chapter 10:
* "What a worm was to a corpse, his sins would be to the painted image on the canvas. They would mar his beauty, and eat away at its grace. They would defile it, and make it shameful. And yet the thing would still live on. It would always be alive." (121)
### Chapter 11:
* "For those treasures, and everything that he collected in his lovely house, were to be to him means of forgetfulness, modes by which he could escape, for a season, from the fear that seemed to him at times to be almost too great to be borne" (142)
	* Material obsession = escapism 
### Chapter 16:
* "Each man lived his own life, and paid his own price for living it. The only pity was one had to pay so often for a single fault. One had to pay over and over again, indeed. In her dealings with man Destiny never closed her accounts" (195)
### Chapter 19:
* "Like the painting of a sorrow, a face without a heart" (221)
* If a man treats life artistically, his brain becomes his heart (221)
