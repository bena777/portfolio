## Summery:

A truly scary story about something I'm not only terrified but also lived through. It is amazing how despite coming out in 1947, this book is eerily similar to the Covid pandemic in 2020. It puts into words a lot of the emotions felt both myself as well as society during that time of isolation, struggling, and the truly absurdist nature of it all. This book is an excellent compliment to [[The Myth of Sisyphus]] as it shows a town going through an absurd situation of life and death and how they cope with it. Reuix in particular is a great absurdist protagonist. 


## Annotations:

* "Perhaps the easiest way of making a town's acquaintance is to ascertain how the people in it work, how they love, and how they die. In our little town all three are done on much the same lines, with the same feverish yet casual air" (1)
* "A pestilence isn't a thing made to man's measure; therefore we tell ourselves that pestilence is a mere bogy of the mind, a bad dream that will pass away. But it doesn't always pass away and, from one bad dream to another, it is men who pass away, and the humanists first of all, because they haven't taken their precautions" (19)
* "Thus in a middle course between these heights and depths, they drifted through life rather than lived, the prey of aimless days and sterile memories, like wandering shadows that could have acquired substance only be consenting to root themselves in the solid earth of their distress" (35)
	* This is literally EXACTLY what it felt like during Covid
* "Yes, plague like abstraction, was monotonous; perhaps only one factor changed, and that was Rieux himself" (44)
* "Yet this calamity was not willed by God. Too long this world of ours has connived at evil, too long has it counted on the divine mercy, on God's forgiveness" (46)
* "Since the order of the world is shaped by death, mightn't it be better for God if we refuse to believe in Him and struggle with all our might against death, without raising our eyes toward the heaven where He sits in silence" (63)
	* Struggle in life instead of believing in a divine power
* "The evil that is in the world always comes of ignorance, and good intentions may do as much harm as malevolence, if they lack understanding" (64)
* "Well, personally, I've seen enough of people who die for an idea. I don't believe in heroism; I know it's easy and I've learned it can be murderous. What interests me is living and dying for what one loves" (81)
* "Plague had swalloed up everything and everyone. No longer were there individual destinies; only a collective destiny, made of plague and the emotions shared by all" (82)
* "Without memories, without hope, they lived for the moment only. Indeed the here and now had come to mean everything for them" (89)
* "For who would dare to assert that eternal happiness can compensate for a single moment's human suffering? He who asserted that would not be a true Christian, a follower of the Master who knew all the pangs of suffering in his body and his soul" (109)
* "No, we should go forward, groping our way through the darkness, stumbling perhaps at times, and try to do what good lay in our power" (110)
* "What's natural is the microbe. All the rest, health, integrity, purity, is a product of the human will, of a vigilance that must never falter" (123)
* "Of all those days and weeks and months of life lost to their love made them vaguely feel they were entitled to some compensation; this present hour of joy should run at half the speed of those long hours of waiting" (142)
* "And to state quite simply what we learn in a time of pestilence: that there are more things to admire in men than to despise" (150)
