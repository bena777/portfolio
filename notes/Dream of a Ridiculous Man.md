### By Fyodor Dostoevsky

* The dream of a ridiculous man is a beautiful story and probably one of my favorite short stories of all time. In just under 20 pages, they are able to show the redemption of the main character, an amazing symbolic dream, and why he continues to live on
* I would also say that it is definitely a piece of absurd fiction I mean the title alone and first page makes it that 


### Annotations 
* "Afterwards, I went to school, studied at the university, and, d you know, the more I learned, the more thoroughly I understood that I was ridiculous" (643)
* "It seemed to me clear that life and the world somehow depended upon me now. I may almost say that the world now seemed created for me alone: if I shot myself the world would cease to be at least for me" (647)
	* Some people may interpret this as arrogance but I disagree
	* I see clear parallels to ideas layed out in [[The Myth of Sisyphus]]
* "But does it matter whether it was a dream or reality, if the dream made known to me the truth" (648)
	* Really powerful quote and one of my favorites from the book
* "Let it be a dream, so be it, but that real life of which you make so much I had meant to extinguish by suicide, and my dream, my dream- oh, it revealed to me a different life, renewed, grand and full of power" (648)
	* Dreams can truly be powerful
* The idea is that a world with sorrow is still better than one that goes nothing wrong or a "paradise". This is because as Camus says, the struggle is what makes life worth living. In a paradise, there is nothing to worry or struggle about therefore the life is not worth living. This makes me 100% sure that this is a work of absurdist fiction.
