### By Murakami 

### Summary
Once again, Murakami has made me ask myself what the fuck I just read. However, this is even more dream like than [[Kafka on the Shore]]. Numerous plot threads, some tied up better than others are constantly flowing throughout the course of this book. Honestly, I really enjoyed my adventure with this book and never really felt bored reading it. I wouldn't say it has to do with absurdism but more so a masterpiece of surrealism art. I genuinely felt like I was dreaming while reading this especially at the end and there was some amazing parts like Mayima's story and the development of Wataya. It's hard to place a general idea or theme for this metaphysical book in general because I truly think this is one of the most subjective and implicit works of fiction I've seen. Honestly, it is hard for me to have a meaning for this book at all and I think that adds to the book itself. I'm not going to sit here and try to decipher every little symbolism and idea brought up in this book because while there are definitely connections, this work is a beautiful abstract painting in novel form.  


### Book I
##### Chapters 1-3
* Already creating a great vibe of this book from the first chapter
* This girl crazy wtf 
* Sensing a strong theme of "people can't truly understand each other" similar to Evangelion in the beginning of this 
* The stuff about understanding the idea of "cycles" more from his wife's period is both funny and interesting 
* "Is it possible in the final analysis, for one human being to achieve perfect understanding of another?" (24)
	* NO.
	* Main theme of Evangelion
	* This entire opening to chapter 2 is great 
##### Chapters 4-6
* "It's not a question of better or worse. The point is, not to resist the flow. You go up when you're supposed to go up and down when you're supposed to go down." (51)
* "But if you payed close attention to what he was saying or what was written, you knew that his words lacked consistency. They reflected no single worldview based on profound conviction" (75)
	* Fuck this guy 
* I actually really like how all of chapter 6 is just the backstory of his wife's brother, it adds a lot more characterization and world-building to the story
##### Chapters 7-9
* The setup for this story is introducing so many interesting characters 
* "Pain was not something that was dealt out fairly" (92)
* "I was living for one thing only, and that was to confirm my own lack of feeling" (99)
	* I think the fact that even after all her pain went away and she was still sad and gloomy means that in reality nothing changed. She was living before to struggle against the pain but now she felt as if she has no purpose
* This wet dream sequence is exactly how it feels for me like when he cums as soon as it starts
* More symbolism with water
* The idea of bald people not liking being bald because it shows your getting closer to death is a cool interpretation 
* "If i'm pessimistic, then the adults in this world who are not pessimistic are a bunch of idiots" (113)
##### Chapters 10-13
* "And every time the wind up bird came to my yard to wind its spring, the world descended more into chaos (125)"
	* IMO the wind up bird represents the cycles in his life as well as a constant that happens every day no matter what 
	* I love this entire last page of chapter 10 
* I absolutely love how we have all these elements going on at the same time in the background like Kumiko's brother running for election, the lady on the phone, and now the soldier
* Hyped for this backstory of Mr. Honda and the soldier 
* "There was no trace of anything as insignificant as human undertaking. This same event had been occurring hundreds of millions or billions of times, from an age long before there has been anything resembling life" (146)
	* Love this idea of cycles
	* This is how I feel when looking at nature as well and it makes me happy, similar to [[Meditations]]
* "A person's destiny is something you look back at after it's past, not something you see in advance" (150)
	* Don't look back
	* Valid quote my only issue is I don't really understand this in context. If he believes this, how is he able to predict peoples future?
* That backstory man... truly a great way to end the first book
* In particular that dialogue about when he's down in the well and sees the ray of light is absolutely spectacular
	* "Yes, that was it: the true meaning of life resided in that light that lasted for however many seconds it was, and I felt I ought to die right then and there" (166)
	* Honestly this kind of reminds me of [[The Myth of Sisyphus]] when Sisyphus turns around and glares at the path he had traveled up the mountain in awe, only to start it all over again the next second
### Book II

##### Chapters 1-3 
* He breaks the 4th wall a bit when he talks about Hemingway; could this be something that carries on in the book?
* God Noboya is such a dick 
* The wind up bird not ringing anymore signifies the simplifies of everyday coming to an end 
##### Chapters 4-6
* Him going down that well to think makes me think of that time I purposely got lost on the bike
##### Chapters 7-9
* "It was a dream but not a dream" makes me think that he just went to the metaphysical world that they've been hinting at this whole time 
* I think that the women on the phone is some form of Toru's mom just cuz Murakami is weird like that 
* I don't understand what this dialogue about pregnancy/abortion means 
##### Chapters 10-12
* Lowkey I read chapter 10 half asleep so I didn't fully process it 
	* I don't really understand the interpretation of him seeing himself as the wind up bird 
	* May brings up a good point about how if we lived forever we wouldn't appreciate anything since we would have eternity ahead of us
* "This person, this self, this me, was made somewhere else. Everything had come from somewhere else, and it would all go somewhere else. I was nothing but a pathway for the person known as me " (262)
	* They've been doing this theme throughout the whole thing 
	* Interesting hmmmm
* "Once it lost its points of demarcation, time ceased being a continuous line and became instead a kind o formless fluid that expanded or contracted at will" (265)
* Bro got an entire letter written to him about how his girl doesn't wanna fuck him anymore thats crazy
##### Chapters 13-16
* Murakami seems to always give me that melancholic feeling
	* Just the way he describes the setting and the people living in it. He paints it almost as this artificial creation which I can def relate to irl
* "Without a true self, though, a person cannot go on living. It is like the ground we stand on. Without the ground, we can build nothing" (306)
* This dynamic between Toru and Wataya is insane
	* "In a world where you are losing everything, Mr Okada, Noboru Wataya is gaining everything" (312)
* This idea of the 3 selfs within Creta is interesting 
	* One was her only feeling pain, one was feeling absolutely nothing, and the current one is somewhere in between where she can actually try to live
* After how Toru described himself splitting into two I feel like the two selfs are his brain and his heart; logical and emotional
	* Although it could have something to do with that white goo shit May was talking about honestly idk
* There is a ton of moving parts in this book. The crazy part is I'm only half way and it feels like it's still getting setup. Really hoping it isn't anti-climatic and we get that payoff because if it does, this could go down as one of my favorites
	* Off the top of my head we have May, the Creta/Malta, the solider, the unknown women on the phone, and Wataya all moving around let's see what happens I'm hyped
### Book III
##### Chapters 1-3 
* Could this middle aged lady be the women on the phone?
* Wtf is going on in chapter 3
##### Chapters 4-6
##### Chapter 7-9
* Oh shit so the room he went to in the metaphysical stuff the first time in the well was the apartment he went to with the middle aged lady in real life
* I'm very interested what is behind that door
* What the fuck is chapter 9
* "Maybe the world was like a revolving door. And which section you ended up in was just a matter of where your foot happened to fall" (411)
##### Chapters 10-15
* So the chapters about the child at night was clearly Cinnamon
* I love in these Murakami books when the various plot threads start to connect like now Watuya's dude was talking about the house and with Cinnamon being the boy in those 2 chapters
* Entertaining read but honestly theres not much to write about it 
##### Chapters 16-18
* May's viewpoint about how people view the world as linear and consistent is interesting and accurate
* "Those people believe that the world is as consistent and explainable as the floor plan of a new house in a high-priced development, so if you do everything in a logical, consistent way, everything will turn out right in the end. That's why they get upset and sad and angry when I'm not like that." (461)
	* My parents are def like this too 
##### Chapters 19-26
* This entire section with the computer is really cool
* Interested in the idea about Nutmeg's idea about "the long arm reaching out" and how she feels that her fate has already been written for her
* Is the vet at the zoo just reincarnated inside of Toru or something?
* Wtf is going on, are we getting some sort of 4th wall break?
* "The cry of this bird was audible only to certain special people, who were guided by it towards inevitable ruin. The will of human beings meant nothing, then, as the vet always seemed to feel. People were no more than dolls set on tabletops, the springs in their backs wound up tight, dolls set to move in ways they could not choose, moving in directions they could not choose. Nearly all within range of the wind-up bird's cry were ruined, lost. Most of them died, plunging over the edge of the table" (525)
	* Fire paragraph, so the wind up bird symbolizes inevitable fate
	* But if the wind up bird is not ringing anymore, does this mean that Toru has taken fate into his own hands?
##### Chapters 27-32
* Man... Mamiya's story really is tragic and honestly my favorite part of the book
* I'm so invested right now and I love how it went back and forth between his dream sequence and Mamiya's story
* That part where he's walking through the hotel almost brings a tear to my eye, reminds me of the song Indoors in OneShot
* "May the life you lead be a good one, a life free of regrets" (564)
##### Chapters 33-
* Wow. The climax of this book was absolutely insane with him running through the halls and fighting that guy in the room
* So the women on the phone and in the hotel room was Kumiko? But then who was the guy that he killed, Noburu?
* Honestly, I don't know who the hollow man is and honestly it doesn't really matter (although this reddit thread about it being Mamiya makes a LOT of sense)
* The dialogue about the pregnancy finally came into play 
* Very good book and ending but still a bit confusing
* Main themes of this book seem to be the idea of not being able to understand each other, people having multiple selfs, and
