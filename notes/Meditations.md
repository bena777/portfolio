## By Marcus Aurelius 
#Philosophy 

Stoicism in general which is the main philosophy of the book is similar to [[Absurdism]] in some ways that it called for accepting how life is and that you can't do anything about it. However, the difference being that Marcus talks often about a higher or universal power that connects us all while absurdism completely goes against that idea. They are similar in a way if you consider the "higher power" (or lack of) of absurdism the absurd itself. I also this book as something that inspired some of my favorite works I have ever read most noticeable being [[Nassim Taleb]] books as well as [[Vagabond]]

While I agree with parts and respect the philosophy of stoicism laid out by Aurelius, I do not subscribe to it completely. I agree with a lot of his opinions regarding nature and not thinking bad of others but where we diverge is when he talks about a higher power controlling us and our lives being decided from the day we are born and even before that. This contradicts with my random philosophy but nevertheless, I enjoyed most of the book. It got a little dull at times since it's not really a story, it's a bunch of statements drawn together which makes sense when you understand the context in which it was written. A lot of statements, particularly in the earlier books stuck with me such as the one refuting depression and appreciating your fellow men. Would definitely recommend to anyone interested in the stoicism philosophy.



### Book I
* Aurelius is a man who despite being rich, lives the life of a simple man 
	* "I was subjected to a ruler and a father who was able to take away all pride from me, and to bring me to the knowledge that it is possible for a man to live in a palace without desiring either guards or embroidered dresses" (6)
* Do not show yourself off as a man who is higher educated or more disciplined
	* The people who tend to do this are people I hate. Just because they are more formally educated doesn't mean they have any right to belittle others 
* Peevish- easily irritated
* Live close to nature while tolerating ignorance 
* This part is mainly Marcus thanking the people that have gotten him to where he is today as well as thanking the gods for giving him a good life while setting up his core values such as connection to nature and living a simple life despite being the emperor 
### Book II
* "Begin the morning by saying to yourself, I shall meet with the busybody, the ungrateful, the arrogant. All these things happen to them by reason of their ignorance of what is good and evil" (8)
	* Be kind to people no matter what
	* Marcus not only talks about being kind to everyone but he also says how you can't let others actions effect yourself
	* We must cooperate with one another instead of arguing 
* Very universal and similar to [[Vagabond]] in the sense that it talks about the world is just how it is and we have to accept that from the heavens
* Live every day like its your last
* If there was a God why would anyone go to hell?
	* If a god exists, he would make sure that every man would not fall into significant evil 
* "For a man cannot lose either the past or the future: for what a man has not, how can anyone take this from him?" (11)
	* No matter how long we live, the present is all we have
	* ?
* The one thing we can be guided by is our personal beliefs and philosophy
* Accept all that happens and await death with a smile because it is an act of nature and nature cannot do any evil
* This book delves into the ideas of immortality, God, and more on nature with not a true main idea besides the last paragraph. I was a bit confused about some of the parts in it so have to do some more research. 
### Book III
* Men have limited time on this Earth but if we lived longer, perhaps we would not have the same desire to seek out knowledge and teachings 
	* We must instead make use of the limited time we do have 
* Sometimes things created by nature that were not even intended to be beautiful become just that 
* "Do not waste the remainder of your life in thoughts in thoughts about others" (14)
	* By doing this, you are losing time for free thinking thought and ideas 
* If something is better than the law or truth according to yourself, do it
* "Every man lives only for the present, which is an invisible point, and that all the rest of his life is either the past or uncertain" (16)
	* Our deaths are only followed up by a longer line of humans who will they themselves die soon with little knowledge of themselves much less us 
* Observing all your surroundings is a great mental exercise
	* "For nothing so promotes elevation of mind as the ability to examine methodically and truly every object that is presented to you in life" (17)2
	* I learned this through my own experience on  [[Lost in Suburbia]]
	* This extends not only to objects but to people as well 
* Don't save something for later on in life, if you want to do it do it NOW
	* We don't know if we will be around to do it later in life as the future is uncertain
* Delves more into depth about Marcus' way of life while going more into concepts such as death and nature 
### Book IV
* Nature will always adapt to its surroundings 
* "Let no act be done without a purpose, nor otherwise than according to the perfect principles of art" (19)
	* All actions should have a goal in mind
* Retreat is just a temporary escape from reality
	* YES, I have been saying this for a while and is why I don't understand the point of vacations other than gaining new experiences
	* "For there is no retreat that is quieter or freer from trouble than a man's own soul" (19)
	* Our real vacation comes from reflecting within ourselves and becoming at peace with ourself
	* Every so often, this mental vacation is needed to cleanse the soul
* The idea of fame or being remembered can trick us
	* "But perhaps the desire of the thing called fame torments you. See how soon everything is forgotten, and look at the chaos of infinite time on each side of the present" (20)
	* No matter how famous you are during your life, it will eventually fade  out in enough time 
	* Because of this, we must not focus on fame and instead settle in the little territory we are in and live free 
	* Everything around us is constantly changing, as is the case with the randomness of the world 
* Everything happens as a random series of events
	* Not quite sure if this is what he's saying I may honestly just want to interpret it this way
* Marcus talks a lot about the idea of eventually dying and coming back to nature in a sense
* "Do not act as if you were going to live 10,000 years. Death hangs over you. While you live, while it is in your power, be good" (22)
	* Love this quote
	* We only have a finite time on this earth so while you are here, be as good and create as positive of an impact as possible to others
* Marcus really sticks to the idea that chasing fame after death is pointless as the people who remember you will eventually fade as well. This is sticking with me as I have always thought that it was important to leave an impact on the world but this is making me question it a bit
* "The universe from the beginning everything that happens has been apportioned and spun out to you" (23)
	* Ok yeah he is talking about that random series of events 
* He goes into the idea of humans fading in a more broad civilization sense of how certain customs and words as well as great rulers eventually fade out and become nothing more than a tale 
* "I am happy happy, though this has happened to me, because I continue free from pain, neither crushed by the present nor fearing the future" (27)
* Easily my favorite book so far; it goes into concepts that genuinely interest me such as:
	* The world being a random string of events
	* Do not search for a lasting impact on the world as that just like everything else will eventually fade out with time as well
	* Do not fear the past because it has already happened or the future because we have no control 
### Book V
* Holy shit what an opening paragraph
* Excellent paragraph talking about how we were born to be humans and with that comes certain things that we must just do in the universe not unlike other animals 
	* "In the morning, when you rise unwillingly, let this thought by present. I am rising to the work of a human being" (28)
	* I'll have to double check but I believe a similar concept is brought up in [[The Myth of Sisyphus]]
	* Marcus writes a beautiful stance on depression here: nature has given us time to rest already but by sleeping in your bed all day, you are not living to your full potential and by doing that you do not love yourself
	* There is people without food or shelter or great living conditions that work towards their craft and hobbies but some with plenty of resources to never go hungry choose to sleep all day and not live up to their potential
* Instead of bragging about your characteristics you were gifted by nature such as attractiveness or intelligence, instead choose to be admired by the things you have accomplished or developed yourself such as working hard, being kind to others, or being contempt with a simple life 
* The universal scale of this guys thinking was unheard of for the far back in history
* Marcus is very into the idea of that (in a short time period) we will eventually be nothing but bones and ashes 
* This book begins by deconstructing the idea of depression and goes on to elaborate more on a universal scale of why we should be kind and the idea of returning back to the Earth after our eventual death
### Book VI
* "The best way of avenging yourself is not to become like the wrongdoer" (37)
	* Instead of enacting revenge of one, the best way to combat someone being a dick is to simply not be THEM and instead choose kindness 
* Humans desire praise from random strangers more than their close family or friends 
* Always assume that mistakes are not done with malicious intent 
* "It is a shame for the soul to be first to give way in this life, when your body does not give way" (41)
	* ?
* Everything is small in the grand scheme of the universe
* These are simply just a bi product of the beautiful universe, with all this good comes bad along with it 
* "That which is not good for the swarm is not good for the bee either" (45)
	* Book VI does not really have a central theme. It is a lot of different seemingly unrelated statements meshed together. Marcus continues to explore universal themes while giving fable like statements about important messages
### Book VII
* Don't let anyone else control your principles or thoughts; your mind is fully controlled by yourself
* Never be ashamed to ask for help. If something in your duty cannot be done by yourself but can be done with someone else, is it not more efficient to get help?
* "Do not let the future disturb you, for you will arrive there, if you arrive, with the same reason you now apply to the present" (48)
	* The future should not scare you, instead work on being the best you can in the present to ensure that the future is one you want
* "Consider yourself to be dead, and to have completed your life up to the present time; and live, according to nature, the remainder that is allowed you" (53)
* Book VII begins with the discussion of the idea of "badness" and goes into thinking your own thoughts as well as plenty more giving yourself to God talks that I sort of glazed over. Pretty solid book. 
### Book VIII
* "Throw away the thought of how you might seem to others, and be content if you live the rest of your life in the manner that your nature wills" (57)
	* I think this is a pretty good general idea for the idea of Stoicism 
	* It does not matter how you seem to other people, focus on living your life as nature intended (or how you want)
* Perturbed- feeling anxiety or concern
* "If a thing is in your own power, why do you do it? But if it is in the power of another, whom do you blame? The atoms (chance) or the gods? Both are foolish. You must blame nobody. For if you can, correct that which is the cause; but if you cannot do this, correct at least the thing itself; but if you cannot do even this, of what use is it to you to find fault? For nothing should be done without a purpose" (59)
	* We should not be worrying about things that are not in our own power
	* Theres no reason to blame chance or a higher power if something happens outside of our control, we shouldn't blame anybody, it just is how the world is and we should accept that 
* Being remembered after you are gone doesn't really matter. 
### Book IX
* Lying is one of the worst things you can do to your fellow men 
* "Do not despise death, but be well content with it, since this too, is one of those things that nature wills" (68)
	* We should not fear death as it is just as natural as having a child, going through puberty, and all of life's other natural occurrences 
* "In a word, if there is a god, all is well; and if chance rules, do not also be governed by it" (72)
	* Marcus relates the idea of God to a world governed by chance which I love
	* I actually agree, I hope there is a God I just don't think there is. However, if we live in a random world like I think we do, theres no reason to go against the chance that you can't control
* I like this book because it goes into a lot of actually questioning the idea of a God in the first place (something that I thought Marcus did indeed believe in) and even comparing a godless world to one of pure randomness which I love
### Book X
* Strong intro that goes into Marcus' own reflection within his body of never being good enough and no matter what happens, always desiring more
	* Shows a human side to him
* Something I disagree with that is prominent throughout this entire book is the idea that our fate has been predetermined since the start of time, I like to instead believe in Souchi's philosophy of "don't look back" and that nothing is ever predetermined 
* Live according to your own principles  and with nature even if people want to kill you over it 
* "No longer talk at all about the kind of man that a good man ought to be, but be such" (80)
* Our bodies are simply a vessel; they are useless without our soul controlling them
### Book XI
* While physical life is short and simply a vassal, the soul inside of us does what WE chose it to do and accomplishes our goals 
* "There is no nature that is inferior to art, for the arts imitate the nature of things" (87)
	* While nature is the best of all, art still has its benefits 
	* These include showing the non perfects of life as well as things that are rare to experience
* If someone offends you consider the following:
	* 1. What is my relation to them
	* 2. What kind of man they are
	* 3. Are they ungrateful or unjust or greedy
	* 4. I may also do wrong
	* 5. It's hard to tell when someone is actually doing wrong or if its just your perspective
	* 6. His life is short and pretty soon we will both be dead
	* 7. Its not the actions, but our own opinions that disturb us 
	* 8. Pain is brought by anger
	* 9. A good disposition is invincible
### Book XII
* Why does everyone value themselves more than anyone else but at the same time, value others opinion more than their own?
* We should not be focussed on the length of our life but instead how we lived what we had
