### Chapter 1: Head Start Riichi
* We can use EV to calculate certain situations in Mahjong such as rather to riichi or dama or when melding a hand which is introduced in [[Riichi Mahjong (book)]]
* Ryanmen- side wait (Ex: 4-5 waiting for 3 or 8)
* This book is cool because it has proven expected value data
* You should ALWAYS riichi when you have pinfu 
* Calculated the round balance (expected value) is too time consuming so instead we use the following as a simplification 
* Round balance = win rate x (point gain + 1500 ) - 1500
	* This 1500 number is the expected point loss when not winning a hand

	* (Table shows expected value of ryanmen riichi)
* As shown from this table, it is clearly better to Riichi sooner rather than later
* Riichi should usually be taken, but in certain cases damaten may make sense in situations where you already have confirmed hanemans OR if you need a win by any means in order to jump a place or two (dama typically has higher win rates due to alerting opponents that your hand is in tenpai)
* The reason that riichi is better in most situations is a simple case of EV: it slightly lowers your win % but greatly increases the average amount of points won 
* Riichi should also usually be called on worse hands such as a closed wait
* Generally, you should declare riichi during a closed wait of either a suji tile or a non suji 1,2,8,9
* However, dama is better if it's late in the round and you are waiting on a non-suji 4,5, or 6 since they are very unlikely to be dropped
* It can make sense to pass on a riichi if you have a chance to turn a bad wait into a ryanmen wait, especially if this also adds other han such as tanyao
* All waits are not created equal, a wait for a 1 is much better than a wait for a non suji 4 since THEY ARE MORE LIKELY TO DISCARD IT (this is definitely something I have been missing)
* The order in terms of most to least discarded when riichi goes suji 1-9, suji 3-7, suji 4-5-6, non suji 1-9, non suji 2-8, non suji 3-7, non suji 4-5-6
* A honor tile wait also almost always calls for a riichi
* If you are trying to decide between a wait between honor and ryanmen, choose whichever one gives you more points. Both give about the same win rates since honor tiles are much more easily discarded by other players
* If they are equal, ryanmen is the better choice
* We can't assume a "bad shape" riichi has only half the win % of a ryanmen riichi
* For chiitoi, waiting on an honor tile with 1 tile already discarded is better than both none or 2
* Sanmenchan- 3 sided wait
* Ryanman > furiten sanmenchan > bad wait > furiten ryanment
* Suji trap riichi- discarding a tile while you riichi that is suji to your winning tile
### Chapter 2: Push/Fold
* The "average" hand value when dealing in is 4300 (5300 with riichi stick)
* Betaori- folding; minimize the chance of dealing into other hands
* When one player riichis
	* The expected amount of P/L points when employing betaori is -1100. This means that you should only push if you feel your EV is >-1100
	* In general, you should push against non dealer riichi
	* it is worth fighting with ryanmen riichi when the value of your own riichi is worth at least a third of that of your opponentâ€™s riichi (5300 for non dealer, 7500 for dealer).
	* If you have a bad shape tenpai and someone else has called riichi, it is only worth pushing if you have at least another han (and most of the time, two other)
* When two players riichi
	* When declaring riichi against 2 existing riichis, the tile you discard is extremely important (emphasis on it being safe or suji)
	* Rynamen wait
		* Push when you have one more han besides riichi if the tile is safe
		* Push when you have two or more han besides riichi if the tile is not safe and non suji
	* Bad wait
		* Need a mangan (4 han) in order to justify pushing a double riichi with a bad wait (but only 2 han as the dealer)
* The more points you have, the less utility there is of winning (more open to folding) and vice versa if you are losing 
* Same idea is further shown as the rounds get closer to the end (if you are losing towards the end, you winning is much more important)
### Chapter 3: Betaori and wait reading
* If choosing to betaori, fully commit to folding
* Discard first tiles that are currently safe but COULD become dangerous in the future
* In the late game, non discarded honor tiles are actually pretty dangerous (more so than suji)
* If someone riichis on a tile, the suji of that tile for that one turn is just as dangerous as non suji tiles due to the suji trap (so don't do suji until after the first turn of riichi; this also does not apply to suji terminal tiles)
* A riichi decleration with a 5 makes 3 and 6 safer but 1 and 4 more dangerous
* Dora tiles are obviously more dangerous
