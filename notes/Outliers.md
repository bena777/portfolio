### By Malcolm Gladwell


### Summery:
I personally thought this book was pretty solid but it definitely dragged on at times. The point Gladwell is trying to make is a good one (that success is brought upon by luck and cultural advantages) which I definitely agree with but at the same time, this book could've been at least 100 pages shorter. I also enjoyed how he tied in the 10,000 hour rule and showed that these people are so successful in the first place like Bill Gates because they were given access at a young age to get more hours in their craft than anyone else. Overall a solid read that made me think more about what success really means in life, I give it a 7/10. 

##### Chapter 1: The Matthew Effect
* It is very rare for people to actually "rise from nothing" as so many say. Our accomplishments were partly or fully caused by our upbringing, advantages we had in life, or even hidden things you would never think about 
* Our culture influences our future legacy
* "The tallest oak in the forest is the tallest not just because it grew from the hardiest acorn; it is the tallest also because no other trees blocked its sunlight, the soil around it was deep and rich, and no lumberjack cut it down" (19)
	* Similar to what I was thinking about school and Gladwell actually brought it up. Basically if you take higher classes in middle school, you learn more and the difference between you and someone who didn't widens in high school. This goes to younger ages as well and is crazy to think about
* This is honestly an issue for society as why are little kids being put in various groups that give them certain advantages/disadvantages that accumulate over time. I much prefer Denmark's approach of not doing this until the age of 10
* This also once again shows me why I don't like gifted classes lol
* Absolutely love the main idea and chapter of this book, hopefully it continues to be this good
##### Chapter 2: The 10,000 Hour Rule
* "Practice isn't the thing you do once your good It's the thing you do that makes you good" (42)
* Gladwell argues that it takes roughly 10,000 hours to be a master of something regardless of how naturally talent you are
* Going back to the first chapter, this one relates by stating that those that have the accumulation advantage get more and more time to put towards their desired subject, getting closer to the 10,000 hour mark than most
* I don't know if I 100% agree with the 10,000 hour rule but it is a good goal to strive for
	* The question of the rule comes from what we define as being a "master" in something is, and I would've liked Gladwell to define that himself
	* I truly believe there are some exceptions to this rule as some people really just are that naturally talented
	* Another thing is this only applies for specific activities such as chess or learning how to play an instrument, I would not be a master of math even after spending 10,000 hours doing it most likely
* Another good chapter and Gladwell continue to hammer the point that success in life is more based on being in the "right place at the right time" then inherit skill or talent
	* This is because opportunities = more practice
##### Chapter 3-4: The Trouble With Genius
* IQ tests are not a reliable predictor of real life success
* After a certain point after you cross a certain thresh-hold, additional IQ does not matter that much and other factors are more important (creativity etc)
	* This can be applied to other things as well such as height in the NBA or the college you attend or even how athletic you are for wrestling (Ricochet)
* What separates people of equal IQ is how they are effectively able to use opportunities they get to their advantage
	* This is established with their cultural upbringing and how they were raised
##### Chapter 5: The Three Lessons of Joe Flom
* "We tell rags-to-riches stories because we find something captivating in a lone hero overcoming overwhelming odds" (120)
* A lot of people who were successful because successful due to working/researching in a niche field that not a lot of people were interested in until it became a big deal (Ex: AI or computers)
	* Another example of being at the right place at the right time 
* "Hard work is a prison sentence only if it does not have meaning" (150)
##### Chapter 6: Harlan, Kentucky
* Our cultural legacy effects how we act
	* Not even just parents and grandparents but 100s of years in the past
* The second part of this book looks to explore the advantages that cultural legacy can give to certain people in order to be successful
* This dude just keeps saying the exact same idea in different forms, I get it already
##### Chapter 7: The Ethnic Theory of Plane Crashes
* Catastrophic failure is usually caused by a combination of errors which individually may not do much but together can cause chaos
* "Each of us has his or her own distinct personality. But overlaid on top of that are tendencies and assumptions and reflexes handed down to us by the history of the community we grew up in" (204)
##### Chapter 8: Rice Paddies and Math Tests
* The hardworking culture in China from being in the rice fields every day leaves the cultural legacy of hardworking Chinese even to this day
* This is why in a subject like math, where effort and curiosity reign supreme, the top countries in the subject are almost always asian
* Pretty good example of a cultural legacy and addresses the infamous stereotype of asians being good at math
##### Chapter 9: Marita's Bargain
* "To build a better world we need to replace the patchwork of lucky breaks and arbitrary advantages that today determine success with a society that provides opportunities to all" (268)
	* This statement pretty much sums up the entire book and finally gives that "solution" moment that I've been waiting for. I still am a bit upset that it was not fleshed out more but at least Gladwell gives SOMETHING here (although he still has yet to say how we could implement this on a wide scale)
* I like how he references his own personal situation in the epilogue
* In the end, successful people cannot attribute their success entirely to themselves. Instead it is a culmination of being in the right place at the right time, cultural legacy from generations before that give them certain advantages or ways of thinking, and of course, there own personal hard word and dedication
