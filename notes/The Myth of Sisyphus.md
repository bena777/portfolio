### An Absurd Reasoning
##### *Absurdity and Suicide*
* "Judging whether life is or is not worth living amounts to answering the fundamental question of philosophy." (4)
	* Camus poses an interesting question to start the book. The idea that nothing really matters except if life is worth living is an interesting perspective. 
	* Life indeed is worth living and by choosing not to kill myself I am affirming that opinion every single day 
* "Killing yourself amounts to confessing. It is confessing that life is too much for you or that you do not understand it" (5)
	* This is why I have always said that suicide is a cowards way out. A lot of people don't want to hear this and I understand the terrible struggles people go through to push them to this point but the fact is is that suicide is the ultimate method of running away.
	* Suicide is a permanent fix to temporary problems 
##### *Absurd Walls*
* "Like great works, deep feelings always mean more than they are conscious of saying." (8)
	* Sometimes, feelings cannot be expressed simply with words
	* The feelings I get when I read works I love such as JoJo or Usogui truly cannot be described 
* "I know men and recognize them by their behavior, by the totality of their deeds, by the consequences caused in life by their presence" (9)
	* We can never know anyone truly besides ourselves, but that does not mean we can acknowledge people for the side that they show to the world 
	* Net impact while your living is the most important factor in judging a person
	* "The only person who can sympathize with and understand you is you. So be good to yourself" - [[Neon Genesis Evangelion]]
* "Yet all the knowledge on earth will give me nothing to assure me that this world is mine. You describe it to me and you teach me to classify it. You enumerate its laws and in my thirst for knowledge I admit that they are true." (14)
##### *[[Philosophical Suicide]]*
* The absurd can be described "by the virtue of disproportion between a mans intentions and the reality he will encounter" (29)
	* We often think of the "absurd" as a concept as something that is impossible. Camus uses examples such as bringing a small sword to a large gun fight or a virtuous man being convicted of a crime. 
* "The absurd becomes god" (33)
	* The inability to understand everything about our world is what makes it beautiful 
	* This sentence clicked to me after a few minutes of thinking and rereading: the absurd LITERALLY is God in a religion type sense
	* People use the idea of an all powerful God to explain the absurdities in our world which brings us back to our quote of the absurd becomes god
	* Camus refers to Christianity as a scam similar to in the book [[God is Dead]]
* What is this "leap" Camus keeps talking about in the chapter?
	* It seems to be that this leap is considered a leap of faith by trying to find meaning in the world through something like religion for example 
* "The absurd is sin without God" (40)
* "Seeking what is true is not seeking what is desirable" (41)
	* The truth is not always good [["Ignorance is Bliss"]]
	* The idea that life is all despair does not stop the absurd man
	* We can accept that life is full of despair while still living a happy life 
* By rejecting the absurdity, you are committing [[Philosophical Suicide]] 
	* Camus is opposed to philosophical suicide and instead chooses to embrace the absurdity
##### *Absurd Freedom*
* "I don't know whether this world has a meaning that transcends it. But I know that I do not know that meaning and that it is impossible for me just now to know it" (51)
	* To me, this quote perfectly describes the concept of [[Absurdism]] and this book in general
	* Camus opens with the opposite to the idea of [[Philosophical Suicide]], that instead of seeing the world through rose colored glasses we should see it how it is: a world without a true meaning beyond what we see 
	* We can only truly understand what we touch and see 
* The absurd man lives  fully within the confines of what he personally knows 
* "Living an experience, a particular fate, is accepting it fully " (53)
	* Despite the world being an absurd one, we must revolt against this 
	* True truth can be found in defiance 
	* The idea of humans fighting back against the absurd world and trying to come to terms with it can be beautiful 
	* SO STRUGGLE [[Usogui Notes]] *Usogui and Absurdism essay?
* The idea of relying on something that has any dependence on luck is GIVING UP YOUR FREEDOM. By relying on your fate through the likes of Destiny, you are shifting control of your own life from yourself to "absurd" forces outside of your own control. This is why Camus talks about by relying only on truths you are absolutely certain of, you are lessoning the impact of the absurd and therefore increasing your personal freedom
* True freedom cannot exist since we are all slaves to the idea of Death
	* "What freedom in the fullest sense without assurance of eternity?" (57)
* Having the greatest number of experiences above all else is the most important
	* "Living life to the fullest"
	* I really liked Camus' analogy to games and about breaking the most amount of records here

### The Absurd Man
* The absurd man prefers courage and freedom over overall meaning in the world 
* "A sub clerk in a post office is the equal of a conqueror if consciousness is common to them" (68)'
	* Similar to what I was thinking about last week and the past fews months that everyone is equal so it is bad to assume that someone is a better person just because they are smarter or stronger; the beauty of the common man 
* "The absurd man is he who is not apart from time" (72)
* "There is no noble love but that which recognizes itself to be both short-lived and exceptional" (74)'
	* Love can be a great thing but expecting it to continue even after both parties death is foolish 
	* Enjoy the time you have now with your loved ones 


## Absurd Creation
* Art is the absurdist man's escapism of the cruel reality of life
* "If the world were clear, art would not exist" (98)
	* All that art comes to is a collection of the artists experiences and thoughts
	* If everything in the world was known, we would not have different interpretations of the world meaning art would be useless as the definitive truth of all would be right in front of us
* Telling a story is creating your own universe
* Fiction is an instrument to express an underlying message/philosophy
* "Art can never be so well served as by a negative thought " (113)
	* Accepting the world has no inherit meaning and choosing to still create art in your life is one of the highest forms of revolt
* We should not look at books by the same author as separate but rather a continuation of the man behind the arts thoughts 

## The Myth of Sisyphus 
* Sisyphus represents the ideal absurd mentality. Instead of despising his life of pushing the rock back and forth, he decides to rebel against the world 
* "The workman of todays works every day in his life at the same tasks, and this fate is no less absurd" (121)
	* Very true, at jobs (especially corporate) we do meaningless tasks such as preparing PowerPoints and bureaucracy related nonsense which is essentially the same act of which Sisyphus is doing with the rock
	* The true consciousness is found when journeying back down the mountain after the rock has fallen contemplating your existence
* The rock represents Sisyphus' fate. And by accepting the absurdity of it, he gains control over his own fate
* "There is no sun without shadow, and it is essential to know the night" (123)
	* There is no good without some bad and we must know the bad side of the world
	* In order to experience happy/fruitful moments, we must also know what it feels like on the OTHER side of negativity. If the world was always a happy place, would those happy moments really feel special? Struggle is what makes those happy moments truly happy
* "At that subtle moment when man glances backward over his life, Sisyphus returning toward his rock, in that slight pivoting he contemplates that series of unrelated actions which becomes his fate, created by him, combined under his memory's eye and soon sealed by his death" (123)
	* At the end of the day, we all create our own fate through our previous actions 
	* Our fate does not truly end until our inevitable death 
	* The absurd man completely controls his own fate 
* ##### "The struggle itself toward the heights is enough to fill a man's heart. One must imagine Sisyphus happy." (123)
	* As stated before, true happiness is found through struggle 
	* Once again the struggle dialogue in [[Usogui Notes]]
	* The true meaning of this entire book: STRUGGLE MAKES LIFE WORTH LIVING
