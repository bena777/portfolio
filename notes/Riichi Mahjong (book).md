### Chapter 3: Basics
* Types of waits:
	* Side wait- 2 different tiles can complete (Ex: 3 and 4, 2 and 5 would be the wait)
	* Closed wait- 1 tile needs to be in the middle to complete (Ex: 3 and 5, 4 would be the wait)
	* Edge wait- 1 tile needs to be on the end (Ex: 8 and 9, 7 would be the wait)
	* #### Side > Closed > Edge
* 3-7 tiles are the most versatile since they have more potential for side waits. This is then followed by the 2 and 8 tiles, then the 1 and 9 terminal tiles, and finally the honor tiles
* Because of this, you should always prioritize waits that feature the more versatile tiles
* Ideally you want to have two pairs in your hand, this is because one of them can be made into a trio while the other one can still serve as the pair you need to win the hand 
* 2 pairs > 1 pair, 4 pairs > 3 pairs
* However, if you want to pon or make your hand open, 3 pairs is the best since after you call pon, it will go back to a 2 pair hand 
* A "stretched shape" (4,5,6,7) should be kept until the hand is one away 
* 5 types of waits
	* Side wait- 3 and 4 with a wait of 2 and 5 (max 8 tiles acceptance)
	* Dual pon wait- 5,5,6,6 with a wait of 5 and 6 (max 4 tile acceptance)
	* Closed wait- 6,8 with a wait of 7 (max 4 tile acceptance)
	* Edge wait- 1,2 with a wait of 3 (max 4 tile acceptance)
	* Single wait- 4 with a wait of 4 (max 3 tile acceptance)
* Obviously, the ones with higher acceptance should be prioritized
### Chapter 4: 5 block system
* He address something I was struggling with immediately at the start of this chapter, the idea that we only have a limited time to make discards so it's hard to consider all the tile efficiency rules 
* The 5 block method is seperating your hand into groups and seeing which tile(s) are redundent
* Sometimes, a hand forms more than 5 blocks. When this happens, you may have to chose to break up one of the blocks based on tile efficiency
* When you have less than 5 blocks, you have to chose between which floating tile to discard. This should be based on the potential value and yaku of the tiles
### Chapter 5: Pursuing Yaku
* ##### Sanshoku (mixed triple chow):
	* Sequences of the same numbered tiles across all three numbered suits 
	* Ex: Numbers 1,2,3 and circles 1,2,3 and bamboo 1,2,3 plus a pair to head it off 
	* I could see this as a good yaku to pursue if you don't want to get tanyao (all simples)
* ##### Honitsu (half-flush):
	* A hand composed of only tiles of a single suit + honor tiles
	* Can be a good thing to combine with other yaku to achieve a high hand value 
	* Most important step of seeing if it is feasible is first using the 5 block method to check if your current blocks work with it 
	* Also consider hand value with and without honitsu. A cheap honitsu hand is not worht much and you may be able to get higher han without going for it
	* Be careful not to reveal to your opponents you are going for honitsu with your discards. Instead of discarding both suits, maybe focus on just one at the start so people do not guess that you are only going for a single suit.
* ##### Toitoi (all triplets) and Chiitoitsu (7 pairs):
		* Often times when pursing 7 pairs, you get to the point where a draw turns one of the pairs into a set 
		* Deciding between going for toitoi or chiitoi is a decision that has to be made
		* Chiitoi is better in situations where:
			* There is a futile pair in hand (2 are already discarded so it will never become a set)
			* No pair of value tiles (dragons)
			* 3+ pairs between 3-7
### Chapter 6: Scoring
* Mangan is 8000 points, haneman is 1.5 times this (12000), baiman is 2 times it at (16000) and yakuman is 4 times it at (32000)
* Steps to calculating the score:
	* 1. Figure out how many han 
	* 2. Figure out minipoints (calculation is weird so honestly idrc)
	* 3. Get the scores
### Chapter 7: Riichi Judgement
* #### Riichi Pros:
	* Gains a yaku 
	* Increase score with ippatsu or ura dora (apparently ura dora is only with riichi)
	* Opponents play more defensive
* #### Riichi Cons:
	* Pay 1000 points for the bet
	* Opponents play more defensive
	* Cannot change hand 
* Riichi SHOULD be played if one of the following is true:
	* Another han besides riichi
	* Hand has a good wait 
	* Your the dealer 
* This basically means the majority of the time you should riichi unless as stated you don't have any han, AND have a bad wait, AND are not the dealer
* Should usually riichi as soon as you can 
* Take the tradeoff between hand value and tile acceptance in a wait as almost an EV type problem
* If your potential winnings can be increased by 2x but your tile acceptance goes down by less than half, you should take the higher winnings 
* Take into account tile acceptance when deciding if a wait is "good"
* Don't call riichi if your potentail wait is two or less tiles (besides honor/terminal)
* Another case not to call riichi is if your in the lead as you don't want to deal into an opponent
* Genbetsu- tiles that are safe
### Chapter 8: Defense Judgement
* When another player has a hand in tenpai, push if 2/3 of the following conditions are met
	* Hand in tenpai 
	* High scoring hand (>7700 3 han prob)
	* Good wait
* Fold if 2/3 of these conditions are met
	* 1 away or more from tenpai 
	* Low scoring hand 
	* Bad wait
* Obviously, it is easy to tell if someone has a ready hand if they declare riichi, but it is more complicated if they have an open hand 
* Pushing in this situation would be like if your in tenpai and just discarding all the tiles that you draw that don't finish your hand 
* Folding would be discarding tiles that are considered genbetsu or safe
* There are 3 types of safe tiles against all opponents
	* The tile discarded by the player to the left 
	* 4th honor tile 
	* Where a sequence or pair is simply not possible (Ex: all 1s and 3s are discarded and 3 2s are discarded, then the 2 would be completely safe to play)
* Suji defense is a strategy to avoid dealing into side wait hands after someone calls riichi 
	* This involves looking at the tiles that the player has discarded 
	* The general idea behind this defense theory is that if someone discards a tile, and it is not ronned, then the sequences that have that tile as a wait make the other tile that is being waited on safe to discard
	* Ex: a 2 is discarded. This tile is involved in the double waits of only 3-4. Because of this, the other wait for this sequence, 5, would be considered "safe"
	* Makes sense to me after thinking about it a bit 
	* People can also use the suji defense as a trap to get you to deal in 
* Kabe is another type of defense that is also known as tile blockade 
	* This is the idea of using the discards of a tile to your advantage in seeing combinations that are impossible 
	* If all 2s are visible or discarded, then the person calling riichi cannot have a 2-3 sequence wait. Going backto suji defense, this means that 1 would be safe since it is the only sequence it is involved in which is now impossible 
	* The safe tiles list for the blockades goes as follows:
		* 1- None 
		* 2- One 
		* 3- One and Two
		* 4- Two and Five
		* 5- Three and Seven
		* 6- Seven and Eight 
		* 7- Eight and Nine 
		* 8- Nine 
		* 9- None 
* If worst comes to worst and you have nothing to discard, start with pairs since if it passes, you'll have another that is safe to discard 
* As well as this, try to avoid discarding the dora and sequences that could involve the dora 
* Assume an opponent has a ready, open hand if they
	* Have 3+ open sets 
	* Keeps discarding the tile he draws 

### Chapter 9: Melding judgement
* Melding is the idea of either calling pon/chi or not
* Do NOT meld if the hand is:
	* Both cheap and far from ready (2+ away AFTER melding)
	* It significantly reduces the hand value
* Don't pon the dragons early for the yaku unless you are close to ready, it is more important to save them in order to discard them as safe tiles 
* One purpose of melding is to complete a bad wait in your hand or even improving another wait 
* Another reason is to complete a yaku 
* Your hand should be close to ready in order to call a concealed kan 
* Make an open kan if:
	* Hand is ready with good wait and decent high value 
	* You are losing badly 
	* Need more dora 

### Chapter 10: Grand Strategies
* Often times if your down in the final round, you will have to play a bit differently than normal 
* Before the final round, consider how far away you are from either first or last place
